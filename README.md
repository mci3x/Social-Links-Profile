## My process

Recreating visuals was easy.

I've spent a lot of time rewriting code, trying to get rid of media queries to get my component to be truly responsive, not adaptive.

Padding in design files is different between sizes. Mobile has only left and right, tablet has it bigger and on all sides and at the desktop version there is no padding.

Finally I had to use two media queries for that.

Changed an accent color and added very subtle shadow to avatar picture at the end

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I know more about responsive design and practical flexbox use
- Getting more familiar with `clamp()` , `min()` and `max()`

### Continued development

Proper responsive design practices without using media queries, Flexbox, Grid, Git

### Useful resources

Good old google search which usually leads to MDN, CSS Tricks or stackoverflow.
VSCode copilot came in handy with calculations
